        ### AWebFactory.com

        Victor Kane is Director/Worker for AWebFactory.com. AWebFactory is now rebooting in the form of two major projects: First, [DurableDrupal Content Migration Rescue](https://github.com/DurableDrupal/ddcmr), so folks can move on with their content; and secondly, as a necessary infrastructure and resource pool to move DurableDrupal forward as a book, an open source project, a community and as a set of services, we are presenting AWebFactory's multiple community offerings and services for modern web application engineering. All based on a decoupled and future proof yet approachable open source architecture.

        AWebFactory was started in 2006 after decades of software development experience led to the creation and use of the web application factory pattern, with the founding of http://awebfactory.com. It has enjoyed great success in mentoring and in helping clients to meet their web app development, process, team training and deployment challenges. AWebFactory was always built upon an agile, test-driven, architecturally centered, iterative and incremental approach based on best of breed frameworks, focusing on client participation. It was a pioneer in creating a transparently rooted workspace in which to house a best-practices cooperative process for clients and their projects.
