              So aren't you sick and tired of tutorials that show how "awesome" and "easy" full stack javascript is, and how you can whip up an app in 5 minutes? Sometimes that's even true. But the apps used in all the shallow examples 99% of the time have one thing in common: they are completely trivial and never touch the real world on several important points:
              </p>

              <ul><li>They are rarely re-usable</li>
                  <li>They almost always include some kind of "free" but actually paid service on the backend</li>
                 <li>They don't take into account how to do things like update to newer versions of frameworks, or deploy apps</li>
                 <li>They often do nothing more than repeat what is already in the docs</li></ul>

               <p>Well, we aren't going to show any over-simplified examples here, everything is a full-blown case study that goes through the complete cycle of disciplines your team really needs to master in order to actually launch real world apps.</p>
